# FilmsFinder
This is a web application, which was made to practice my skills and add a new projcet to my portfolio.
Key concepts: search for movies, add the ones you liked to favourites page (there you can delete them, if you don't like anymore).

-------------------------------------------------The Story of DevelopmentðŸ˜Š------------------------------------------------------
The main idea was given to me by my friend Max Basov. I liked it and started to search for an api, which gives me an access to movies database and variety of requests.
In the end, i chose TMDB API. That is the fundamental thing of my web app. I enjoyed the process of development, because i was learning whole a lot new things, features,
that i hadn't used before. 

But it's not the end, i'll add new features like custom search by different criterias and so on.
